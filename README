# The Upper Model
One can build a develop envrionment for the `H-TSP` by using Docker with the `Dockerfile`.

The main code of the reinforcement learning training and the TSP environment locate in `train.py`. 
Details about the neural networks and other miscellaneous are in `rl_models.py` and `rl_utils.py`.

Usage:
```
python train.py
```
This will train the upper model jointly with lower model, the experiment hyperparameters are in `config_ppo.yaml`.

# The Lower Model
Codes of the lower model are in the `rl4cop` folder. Refer to `README` in the folder for more details.
